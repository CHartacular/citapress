<h3> Foreword </h3>
<p>Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wall-Paper” (1892) holds an important place among rediscovered works by turn-of-the-century American women writers for its bold critique of gender politics in a patriarchal society. The nameless narrator, undergoing the infamous rest cure for what doctors now diagnose as postpartum depression, experiences debilitating psychological effects.  At first repulsed by the wallpaper in the room where she is sequestered in a country estate, the narrator comes to like it as she vows to decodes its pattern—she imagines many women creeping behind bars and identifies with one trapped woman, arguably a reflection of her painful position as a woman in Victorian America. Many of the story’s first readers considered it a psychological horror tale in the fashion of Poe.  Gilman had difficulty publishing this story in a male-dominated literary marketplace, but of her remarkable output of novels, stories, poetry, and theoretical works that challenge female subjugation and argue for equal rights, she is best known today for <i> Herland </i>(1915), a feminist utopian novel, and "The Yellow Wall-Paper.”  Hailed as a feminist text in the 1970s, “The Yellow Wall-Paper” is now a canonical work anthologized in collections of American literature and women writers. </p>
