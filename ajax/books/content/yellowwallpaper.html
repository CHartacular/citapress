<h3> Foreword </h3>
<p>Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wall-Paper” (1892) holds an important place among rediscovered works by turn-of-the-century American women writers for its bold critique of gender politics in a patriarchal society. The nameless narrator, undergoing the infamous rest cure for what doctors now diagnose as postpartum depression, experiences debilitating psychological effects.  At first repulsed by the wallpaper in the room where she is sequestered in a country estate, the narrator comes to like it as she vows to decodes its pattern—she imagines many women creeping behind bars and identifies with one trapped woman, arguably a reflection of her painful position as a woman in Victorian America. Many of the story’s first readers considered it a psychological horror tale in the fashion of Poe.  Gilman had difficulty publishing this story in a male-dominated literary marketplace, but of her remarkable output of novels, stories, poetry, and theoretical works that challenge female subjugation and argue for equal rights, she is best known today for <i> Herland </i>(1915), a feminist utopian novel, and "The Yellow Wall-Paper.”  Hailed as a feminist text in the 1970s, “The Yellow Wall-Paper” is now a canonical work anthologized in collections of American literature and women writers. </p>

<p>Gilman’s tale reacts to the prevailing nineteenth-century medical model that placed blame for a woman’s nervousness and fatigue on her womb. The rest cure for what the Victorians called neurasthenia—administered in the story by the patronizing physician-husband, Dr. John, and his sister, Jennie, “a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper”—mandates complete repose and forbids all stimulating activities, including writing. However, the narrator believes writing will make her well, so she writes in secret.  The story unfolds like a diary; over the twelve entries, she descends into a state that some critics call madness but others read as liberation from her patriarchal society.</p>

<p>Gilman explains the story’s autobiographical roots and her reason for writing it in <i>Forerunner</i> (1909-16), a monthly journal that she singlehandedly wrote and published. Gilman experienced a severe postpartum depression after the birth of her only child, Katharine, in her first year of marriage to artist Charles Walter Stetson (on 2 May 1884); her rather conventional husband became a prototype for John in the story. Leaving Katharine and Walter, Charlotte traveled from her home in Providence, RI to California to visit friends and recovered her health; upon her return home, she succumbed again to depression.  In 1887, Gilman consulted a leading physician for women’s nervous complaints, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, who prescribed the rest cure.  Mitchell’s treatment led to disastrous consequences that Gilman later described in her autobiography,<i> The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman</i> (1935)—losing her grip on sanity, she crawled on the floor and played with a baby rag doll.  Gilman recovered from her breakdown by reengaging in the intellectual activity severely limited by Mitchell’s rest cure.  She wrote “The Yellow Wall-Paper” in reference to her own struggles with the real-world Mitchell; Dr. John threatens to send the narrator to Weir Mitchell if her condition does not improve. Gilman notes in “Why I Wrote ‘The Yellow Wallpaper’” (<i>Forerunner </i>4 [October 1913]: 27) that she greatly exaggerated her own breakdown—she never had hallucinations about the wallpaper decorations of her room; she sent the story to Mitchell to convince him of the “error of his ways.” Gilman separated from Stetson in 1888 and launched her career as a lecturer and writer to advance women’s emancipation. She divorced Stetson in 1894 and married her first cousin, Houghton Gilman, in 1900, on the condition marriage would not preclude her writing about “important truths” to make what she called a more “human world.” </p>

<p>Students of literature and critics alike have read, debated, and critiqued “The Yellow Wall-Paper” from a range of theoretical perspectives—sociological, psychoanalytical, feminist, new historicist, queer theory, biographical, and a combination of these approaches.  The story’s style and contents invite questions to ponder.  Do the blank spaces between her undated entries, taut sentences, and short paragraphs reflect the narrator’s increasing psychological fragmentation?  Why does John call the narrator his “little girl” and “blessed little goose” and insist that she rest in a former nursery? Do the bars on the nursery window, nailed down bed, and gate at the top of the stairs symbolize patriarchal domination, infantilization, or both? Is the narrator hallucinating or reading the wallpaper to decipher its pattern? Do the creeping women the narrator imagines trapped behind the “bars” of the wallpaper document her increasing delusions or a larger awareness of the restrictions of patriarchy?</p> 

<p>Perhaps most provocative is the story’s ambiguous conclusion.  How do we interpret the narrator’s final state—is it liberation, defeat, or a qualified victory?   In freeing the trapped woman and locking John out of her room, is the narrator descending into madness or liberating herself? Could the narrator’s creeping signify rebirth rather than regression? Despite her insane actions, might the narrator be gaining her own voice, leading to her declaration in the final entry:  “‘I’ve got out a last . . .  in spite of you and Jane!’”?  And who is Jane?  Is it Jennie (her sister-in-law) or her own repressed self? </p>
  
<p>Cita Press has reproduced the original 1892 <i>New England Magazine </i>version with three illustrations by staff illustrator Jo. H. Hatfield to allow readers to experience this landmark tale as Gilman’s first audience did. Hatfield’s first illustration shows a respectable looking Victorian woman writing her story, but the third depicts a madwoman crawling on all fours, likely influencing some of the story’s original readings as a horror tale.  Cita also preserves Gilman’s notoriously inconsistent spelling of “wallpaper,” written variously as “wall-paper” and “wall paper” and simply “paper,” a variation that suggests the narrator, denied any form of paper, is reading the wallpaper as if it were a text. </p>

<p>This riveting story is rooted in Gilman’s life and patriarchal Victorian America, but it is also relevant to our time. The questions Gilman raises about the cost of women’s traditional roles as wife and mother still captivate, perplex, and challenge readers today.</p>
