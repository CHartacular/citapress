  <p><span class="mini-title">What:</span> Carefully designed public-domain books written by women in free, contemporary editions for print and web. </p>

  <p><span class="mini-title">How:</span> cita is a collaborative labor of love between designers and writers that relies on public-domain writings and open-source texts, fonts, code, and images. All the content of cita is either public-domain, or is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons License CC-NC-SA 4.0</a>, meaning it’s free forever, and sharable for non-commercial purposes so long as you can share if you say who created it. For example, to develop the virtual booklet version of each book we use <a href="https://github.com/evnbr/bindery">Bindery</a>, by Evan Brooks. For more details, check the <a href="ajax/credits.html">full list of credits</a>.

  <p><span class="mini-title">Why:</span> Women authors have historically been underrepresented and underpublicized in the male-dominated, profit-driven publishing industry. We make these women writers’ works accessible to all, in contemporary editions, for free!</p>

  <p><span class="mini-title">Who:</span> cita was created by <a href="http://julianacastro.co">Juliana Castro</a>, a Colombian graphic designer and editor, in collaboration with a gigantic and growing list of <a href="ajax/credits.html" data-title="Credits">contributors</a>. <a href="ajax/collaborate.html">Join us</a></p>
