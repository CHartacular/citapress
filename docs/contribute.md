# How to Contribute

Hi! We're very excited that you're interested in contributing to Cita.

We're currently in the process of cleaning up our library of books so that it's easier to mantain, edit and add to. In this process, we've decided to create an [entirely separate repository](https://github.com/citapress/books) where edited books will live.

If you wanna contribute to this process, [you can get started on the issues labeled `repo migration`](https://github.com/citapress/citapress/labels/development).
