      <p>Cita is an independent press publishing open-licensed books written by women. We provide readers with carefully designed copies of books to be viewed on screen or printed at home, for free. We will teach how to print, stack, fold and bind the books. You can bind them yourself, read them online or purchase hard copies made by us! We make the content available, you do what you wish with it.</p>

      <p>Female writers have been, and continue to be, underestimated and underpublicized. Cita is a response to female underrepresentation and the limitations of accessing their literature. We embrace and encourage open-access and bring visibility to women writers. There are countless works written by women that are now available in the public domain. However, many of these pieces do not make their way into contemporary publishing houses to be distributed widely and inexpensively. By creating this Creative Commons based resource, we attempt to help democratize books.</p>
      <p>The first collection of non-fiction books will soon be online and public for anybody to read and share. It will include works by writers such as Mary Ann Evans and Violet Paget. While we finish our books and this site, please stay tuned by following us on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/cita.press">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/citapress">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/citapress">Facebook</a>.</p>
